### Philosophy
Epicodus's mission is to help people learn the skills they need to get great jobs. For us, “great jobs” means jobs in growing industries that pay well and provide rewarding work. Beyond the particular skills needed to get these jobs, we aim to help our students become confident self-teachers who can adapt to changing job markets, and great communicators who will work well in teams. We focus on serving people who, by birth or circumstance, don't have easy access to learning the skills they need to get these great jobs.

### History
Our president, Michael Kaiser-Nyman, founded Epicodus in 2012. After becoming frustrated with how difficult it was to hire programmers for his software company, he talked with other employers and discovered he wasn't alone. At the same time, he knew many people who were struggling to find work. He realized that if there were a school that taught practical software development skills, people could get great jobs and companies could hire the staff they need.

Epicodus's first class started in early 2013 with just Michael and 8 students. Since then, we've grown to more than a dozen staff and hundreds of students and alumni.
